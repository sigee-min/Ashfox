- export target: GeckoLib 5, Bedrock, GLB, or glTF;
- minimal reproduction steps;
- expected and actual results;
- the shortest safe error message or screenshot that explains the problem.

Do not attach private projects publicly. Create a minimal `.ashfox` reproduction

## Blockbench MCP issues

Include:

Before opening an issue:

1. In Blockbench settings (`ashfox: Server`), set `MCP Host`, `MCP Port`, `MCP Path`.
2. Reload the plugin and check the runtime status signal:
   - `ashfox MCP inline: <host>:<port><path>` or
   - `ashfox MCP sidecar: <host>:<port><path>`
3. Test the exact endpoint from the status signal with `tools/list`.
