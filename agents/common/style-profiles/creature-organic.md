# Style Profile: Creature Organic

## Intent
Organic creature surfaces with clear anatomical volumes and soft material transitions.

## Palette Rules
- Keep base hues grounded and slightly desaturated.
- Reserve high-saturation accents for focal areas only.

## Shading Rules
- Emphasize volume transitions (muscle, joints, neck, jaw).
- Use soft gradients plus sparse texture variation.
- Maintain directional consistency across connected parts.

## Geometry Rules
- Prioritize readable anatomy over tiny details.
- Preserve joint clearance for animation deformation.

## Failure Signals
- No volume separation between major muscle groups.
- Random detail texture without anatomical structure.
- Harsh tonal jumps on curved forms.
