# Run Service Health Checks

## Goal

Detect operational drift before release or deployment updates.

## Steps

1. Execute repository quality gates (`npm run quality`).
2. Run docs quality checks (`npm run docs:quality`).
3. Build docs static output (`npm --workspace apps/docs run build`).
4. Confirm static policy gates (`npm run quality:check`).
