# Run Service Health Checks

## Goal

Detect operational or contract drift before release.

## Steps

1. Execute repository quality gates (`npm run quality`).
2. Run docs quality checks (`npm run docs:quality`).
3. Build docs static output (`npm --workspace apps/docs run build`).
4. Confirm release validation (`npm run release:validate`).
