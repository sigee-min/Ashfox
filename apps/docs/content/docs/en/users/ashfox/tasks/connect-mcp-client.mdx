# Connect External MCP Client

## Goal

Establish stable MCP connectivity from non-Blockbench clients.

## Steps

1. Confirm gateway endpoint path and authentication assumptions.
2. Execute handshake and capability discovery (`system.list_capabilities`).
3. Run one read-only project call to verify payload path.
4. Validate error mapping and retry behavior in client logs.
