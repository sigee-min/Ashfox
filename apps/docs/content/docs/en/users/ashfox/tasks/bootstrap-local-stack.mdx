# Bootstrap Local Service Stack

## Goal

Run the full Track B service shape locally with predictable startup order.

## Steps

1. Install dependencies at repository root (`npm install`).
2. Build required packages (`npm run build`, `npm --workspace apps/web run build`).
3. Start gateway and worker processes (or Docker compose baseline).
4. Validate endpoint reachability from a client.
