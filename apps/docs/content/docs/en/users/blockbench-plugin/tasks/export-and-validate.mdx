# Export and Validate Release Candidate

## Goal

Run validation gates and export artifacts that are ready for handoff.

## Steps

1. Run model checks with `project.validate`.
2. Resolve findings and re-run validation until clean.
3. Export output with `project.export`.
4. Save trace log for auditability (`project.export_trace_log`).
